    <h3>The PR and News Interface</h3>
    <p>
    PR practitioners and journalists often work closely together in the news arena. This is because journalists rely on sources for much of their information and access to these sources is often provided by press officers and PR teams. As gatekeepers of the news content and distribution mechanism, PR practitioners often control the news flow.
    <br><br>
    A study commissioned by The Guardian’s Nick Davies to coincide with his book Flat Earth News, revealed some interesting statistics which suggest that PR professionals are successful in leading the news content of quality newspapers. Davies calls this content ‘churnulism’ and highlighted a study by Cardiff University School of Journalism, which showed that up to 60 per cent of quality-print stories consist wholly or in part of wire copy and/or PR material.

    <h5>The press release</h5>
    <p>
    The press release remains the workhorse of most media relations programmes. This tried-and-tested way of generating column inches is still the preferred option for the PR practitioner or consultancy team intent on winning coverage for their clients.
    <br><br>
    The press release is journalistic in format, versatile and can be adapted to a variety of media relations situations. Consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>General news story:</b> a ‘top line’ story written for and distributed to principal target news media.</li>
        <li><b>Specialist news stories:</b> a series of stories ‘sliced and diced’ to meet more specialist needs, for example a PR team might carve up a large survey into a variety of stories according to vertical sector interest. Many business stories also fit this category.</li>
        <li><b>A feature:</b> news stories are often used as the starting point for a more extended news feature, perhaps in conjunction with a backgrounder. Features editors and writers often find their stories this way.</li>
        <li><b>Press conferences:</b> if you have decided to hold a press conference or media briefing – and the decision will hang on the quality of the news values* you are looking at – then the news release will underpin what is said at the event and form the basis of the story that journalists will take away and write.
        <br>
        <b>*</b> Press conferences should only be held when the news value is high, as getting journalists to attend any event can be difficult </li>
        <li><b>Blogs and tweets:</b> used as starting points for a range of social media communications, certainly by bloggers and users of Twitter feeds, but also LinkedIn and Facebook.</li>
     </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Key Terms</h5>
    <p>
    <b>Copy</b> – written matter aimed at communicating a story or message and intended to be reproduced in printed form; it could be the text of a news release, advertisement, article or blog.
    <br><br>
    <b>Gatekeeper</b> – anyone who can influence the content or timing of the message (for example, a client, manager or regulatory body). For a PR practitioner or press officer, journalists are usually the gatekeepers who directly influence when a story is released and what it says.
